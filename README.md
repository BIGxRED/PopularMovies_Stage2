# PopularMovies_Stage2

This is an app that was developed as a part of the [Udacity Android Development Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) program. The primary purpose of this app is to help end users discover popular and top-rated movies from the web. It is built on top of [PopularMovies_Stage1](https://github.com/mikepalarz/PopularMovies_Stage1) by adding new features such as:

- Allowing end users to now create their own personal favorites of the movies that are displayed.
- Data persistence is offered via a local SQLite database.
- The user now has additional features from the details screen such as watching movie trailers and sharing the movie.
