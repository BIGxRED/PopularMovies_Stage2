A menu is also configured in order to allow different sorting options, such as sorting by
popularity and top rated movies. Pagination (infinite scrolling) is implemented, such that
when the user scrolls to the bottom of the current collection of movies, another API query is
initiated and additional movies are appended to the current view.
